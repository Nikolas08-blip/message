                    <p>
                        I know this might seem random, and I apologize if it does, but I’ve been meaning to share something I’ve kept to myself for a while.

I came across your story one day, and for some reason, you stayed on my mind. At first, I thought it was just a simple internet crush, maybe it still is, but I’ve found myself looking forward to your stories, posts and even your facebook lives. I love your voice (plus guitarist pa gyud!).
                    </p>

                <div id="f3" class="front-content">
                    <p>
                        What I want to say is, if it’s alright with you, I’d like us to get to know each other and see where things might go.

I’m 24, currently studying at CSU. I’m 5'7, not a 10 kind of guy, but what I can offer is honesty and faithfulness. I love playing guitar, music, reading manga and manhwa, and I’m a bit on the introverted side.

I know you’re busy kay 4th year naka (good luck, by the way!) and I truly respect that. I’m not expecting an answer right away, you can take your time. I don’t want to get in the way of your goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Wish you all the best, and have a wonderful evening.
                    </p>
