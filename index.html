                        I know this is gonna be random and weird and I apologize but I just wanted to share something I've kept in a 
                        whileâ€”As I was randomly watching other people's story I came across yours and ever since then you were stuck in my mind. I don't know why, at first I thought that
                        maybe this is just a simple internet crush. Maybe it is or maybe it's just "limerence" char. Ever since that 
                        day I looked forward to seeing your story and sometimes during your facebook live . I love your voice, 
                        plus guitarist pa gyud.

                        5'7 guy, I may not be a 10, but what I can offer you is honesty and faithfulness. I love playing guitar, I love music,
                        a Manga and Manhwa reader, and a bit on the introverted side. I know how busy you are as you are already
                        in your 4th year(goodluck) I a truly respect that and I'm not expecting you to say yes or give an answer right after
                        reading this. I want you to take your time and decide when you're ready as I don't want to get in the way of your goals.
